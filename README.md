# credit_card_fraud_detection
In this project, I use Python to explore the Credit Card Transactions Fraud Detection Dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kartik2112/fraud-detection). 

My research aims are: 
1) Examine the data and identify three distinct profiles (different sets of personal attributes) that are linked to high levels of fraudulent actions.
2) Identify if there is a strong relationship between the transaction amounts and the time of day of the transactions. 

From the results of data exploration, machine learning models were built (using Weka) to detect fraud transactions based on customers’ spending behaviour, transaction amount, transaction time, spending categories and customers’ age. The best model (built by the Decision Tree algorithm) has 98.02% accuracy and 98% Recall.
